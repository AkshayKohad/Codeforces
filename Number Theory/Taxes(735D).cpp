//The first obvious fact is that the answer for prime numbers is 1. If the number is not prime, then the answer is at least 2.
//When is it possible? It is possible in 2 cases; when it is sum of 2 primes of its maximal divisor is 2. If 2 divides n, then so does integer n/2. 
//n/2<=2=>n<=4=>n=4, where n is prime. According to Goldbach's conjecture, which is checked for all numbers no more than 10^9, every number is a sum of two prime numbers.
//Odd number can be sum of two primes, if (n-2) is prime (the only even prime number is 2). Otherwise, the answer is 3 â€” n=3+(n-3), (n-3) is sum of 2 primes, 
//because it is even.
